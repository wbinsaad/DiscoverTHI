# DiscoverTHI
Discover THI is game to Discover Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt campus in Ingolstadt


## Project Overview

As campus life becomes increasingly digital, new students often face challenges in adapting to campus resources and facilities. For many, mastering the use of basic campus tools such as printers and navigation systems is an essential part of their transition into university life. However, traditional orientation methods often fail to provide an engaging, hands-on learning experience.

**Discover THI** is an AR game designed to help new students at the THI quickly familiarize themselves with essential campus resources. The game offers an interactive, immersive environment where students can learn how to use campus facilities such as printers, navigate the campus using AR, and solve puzzles related to campus life.

By gamifying this process, **Discover THI** aims to make learning about campus resources both fun and educational, reducing the anxiety many new students feel when navigating unfamiliar environments. Through this project, we aim to enhance the overall student experience, helping them integrate into campus life with ease, while also promoting the use of digital tools in educational settings.


## Project Objectives

The main goal of the project is to design and develop an interactive AR-based game, that helps new students quickly adapt to campus life and effectively utilize campus resources. The specific objectives of the project are as follows:
* **Enhance User Experience:** Provide an engaging, immersive game experience that allows students to learn how to use campus resources in a fun, interactive way. The goal is to reduce the monotony of traditional learning methods and alleviate the stress new students often experience.

* **Achieve Technical Goals:** Implement an AR-based campus navigation system that enables users to interact with campus resources using their phone's camera and receive real-time feedback. Optimize the game interface to ensure smooth and intuitive operation, especially in terms of AR object detection and interaction.

* **Meet User Needs:** Tailor the game for new students at THI to help them quickly become familiar with essential campus facilities such as printers. Through game elements like hints and mini-games, guide users step by step in mastering the necessary skills, while enhancing their sense of achievement with features like a virtual backpack or a student card.

* **Address Key Problems:** Challenges in adapting to campus resources: New students often feel overwhelmed by the unfamiliarity of campus facilities and may struggle with initial usage. Barriers to information access: Traditional orientation methods, such as printed guides or static maps, are not engaging and may not effectively communicate how to use campus resources.
